    "## Tooling ##\n",
    "I feel that deciding how to manage data is the first time we need to make some decisions about tooling. There are a lot of options, and while I'm sure there are some strong opinions, I may not adhere to them. I have only a couple of criteria:\n",
    "- Cloud hosted, for the most part\n",
    "- Inexpensive\n",
    "- Provides a learning opportunity\n",
    "- Extendable\n",
    "\n",
    "For that last point, I may change my decisions later. But I will do my best to choose initial tools that will allow me to make those changes later. Most importantly, I'm going to try not to overthink it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first prototype, I am going to keep it as simple as there is and use sqlite. We don't have too much data, so I don't think it should be a problem. That way, this is all relatively portable, and I won't have to pay for any cloud resources until I have an initial working version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing Pipeline ###\n",
    "There are two items I want to accomplish when cleaning up the data:\n",
    "- Set the `Card number` field as a simple integer. The number of cards in the set can be captured later as an attribute of the set.\n",
    "- Get links for all the images. I will download the images later and update the links to a location I control.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process the card number ####\n",
    "I will want to build a function to read in the file and update the attribute. I will be able to build a pipeline that executes all those functions later."
