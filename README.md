# TCG Tracker #

There are many goals in this project, but I am going to start simple. Ultimately, I want to understand if it makes more sense to buy singles or a booster box for a given game. Because of the newness, and relative simplicity, I am going to start with Disney Lorcana.

The initial steps I plan to take are as follows:

    Build a list of all the cards
    Do some analysis to understand what we are likely to get out of a booster box
    Understand prices of boxes vs. singles when building a collection or deck

Longer-term Goals

I would like to do more sophisticated data science once I have the basics. For instance, there are a lot of youtubers and streamers who open packs on video. I would love to build a computer vision tool that can determine which cards are being pulled. That would allow me to build realistic pull rates.

I would also like to build a simple web app that will allow people to simulate pack and box openings, both for fun, and to analyze the cost of particular decks or collections.
